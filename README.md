## Overview

Upperoom provides a unique solution tailored specifically for students seeking accommodation. Our platform offers a user-friendly interface where clients can subscribe to specific locations and types of accommodation. Through notifications and an efficient payment system, we facilitate quick and easy access to verified listings.

## Key Features

- **User Registration**: Clients can easily create accounts to access our services.
- **Subscription Notifications**: Clients subscribe to specific listings to receive timely notifications about availability.
- **Listing Verification Process**: Each listing goes through a verification process, ensuring authenticity and quality.
- **Complaint Management**: In the event of an issue, clients can raise complaints, allowing for prompt resolution and maintaining trust within the community.
- **Earnings for Creators**: Property owners earn income from verified listings, incentivizing them to provide quality accommodations.

## How It Works

1. **Registration**: Clients create an account on Upperoom.
2. **Subscription**: Clients subscribe to preferred locations and types of accommodation to receive alerts for new listings.
3. **Verification Process**: Upon viewing a listing, clients have 3 days to confirm availability. If confirmed, the listing status changes to "verified," and the subscription amount is adjusted.
4. **Complaint Resolution**: If issues arise, clients can raise complaints, and listings enter a probation status for resolution.
5. **Earnings Distribution**: Verified listings that reach the "settled" status provide income to creators based on agreed percentages.

### Listing Statuses

- **Unverified**: Initial status for new listings.
- **Verified**: Confirmed by clients or automatically verified after 3 days of inactivity.
- **Probation**: Temporary status during complaint resolution.
- **Rejected**: Listings that are no longer eligible for showing.
- **Settled**: Listings that have successfully transitioned through the verification process.

## Business Model

Upperoom operates on a subscription-based model, where clients pay a fee for access to notifications and listings. Creators earn a percentage from verified listings, fostering a mutually beneficial relationship between clients and property owners. Our approach ensures that clients are not charged for listings that fail to achieve verified status, enhancing user satisfaction.
