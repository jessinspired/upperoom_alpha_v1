## How It Works

Upperoom operates through a straightforward process designed to enhance the user experience for both clients and creators. Here's a step-by-step guide on how the platform functions:

1. **Registration**: 
   - Clients visit the Upperoom website and complete a simple registration process by providing their details, including name, email, and password.
   - Upon successful registration, clients receive a confirmation email to verify their account, ensuring security and authenticity.

2. **Subscription**:
   - Once registered, clients can log in to their accounts. Clients can select their preferred locations and types of accommodation (e.g., apartments, shared houses) and subscribe to receive alerts when new listings that match their criteria become available.
   - Subscriptions are customizable, allowing clients to manage their preferences and receive notifications tailored to their needs.

3. **Verification Process**:
   - When a client views a subscribed listing, they have a 3-day window to confirm that the listing is valid and legitimate.
   - During this period, clients can inspect the property (if possible) and communicate with the creator to gather more information.
   - Clients have the option to raise a complaint if they find any discrepancies or issues with the listing information during the verification process. This ensures that all listings meet the platform's quality standards.
   - If the client does not take any action within the 3-day period, the listing is automatically assigned a status of "verified." This assumes that the client has viewed the listing and the notification was opened without any further action.
   - If the client confirms the availability and legitimacy of the listing within the 3 days, the listing status changes to "verified," and the client's subscription amount is adjusted accordingly.
   - If the client raises a complaint during this period, the listing will enter a "probation" status for resolution.

4. **Complaint Resolution**:
   - If clients encounter any issues with a listing during the verification period, they can raise a complaint directly through the platform.
   - Upon receiving a complaint, the listing enters a "probation" status. During this time, the creator is expected to respond to the client's concerns.
   - If the creator fails to respond to the issue or complaint, the listing status will be promoted to "rejected." 
   - Creators who frequently receive rejections (a maximum of 3 times) risk having their accounts suspended or banned from the platform.

5. **Earnings Distribution**:
   - Listings that successfully transition from verified to "settled" status generate income for creators.
   - Creators earn a percentage of the subscription fee based on the terms agreed upon during the posting of the listing.
   - This income model incentivizes creators to maintain high-quality listings and foster positive relationships with clients, ensuring mutual benefits for both parties.


### Listing Statuses

- **Unverified**: Initial status for new listings.
- **Verified**: Confirmed by clients or automatically verified after 3 days of inactivity.
- **Probation**: Temporary status during complaint resolution.
- **Rejected**: Listings that are no longer eligible for showing.
- **Settled**: Listings that have successfully transitioned through the verification process.

## Business Model

Upperoom operates on a subscription-based model, where clients pay a fee for access to notifications and listings. Creators earn a percentage from verified listings, fostering a mutually beneficial relationship between clients and property owners. Our approach ensures that clients are not charged for listings that fail to achieve verified status, enhancing user satisfaction.
